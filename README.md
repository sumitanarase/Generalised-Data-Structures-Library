# Generalised-Data-Structures-Library
This project is considered as a library which contains generic implementations of all
major types of data structure.
We provide the readymade implementations of all fundamental operations as well as
advanced operations on linear, non linear data strutters in an object oriented way.
We provide the generic way of implementation so we can use the functionality for
any type of data types.
All the object oriented design policies are used in this project
